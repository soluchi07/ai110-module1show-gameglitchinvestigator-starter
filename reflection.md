# 💭 Reflection: Game Glitch Investigator

Answer each question in 3 to 5 sentences. Be specific and honest about what actually happened while you worked. This is about your process, not trying to sound perfect.

## 1. What was broken when you started?

- What did the game look like the first time you ran it?
  - it was an interface that asked you to guess a number between 0 and 100
  - you keep putting in number and clicking guess to submit the guess
  - press new game to start a new game and hint checkbox to toggle hints 

- List at least two concrete bugs you noticed at the start  
  (for example: "the secret number kept changing" or "the hints were backwards").
  - the new game button didnt work and a new game didnt start
  - it didnt give me all the attempts i had left (wasted an attempt without giving a hint when i used enter insted of submit)
  - hints are backwards

## 3. Debugging and testing your fixes

- Did AI help you design or understand any tests? How?

- How would you explain Streamlit "reruns" and session state to a friend who has never used Streamlit?
